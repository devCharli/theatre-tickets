# Movie Booking üçø

This movie booking app allows moviegoers to book a movie and seats. I got the project idea from the vanilla javascript course I took. I wanted to built the same app with react.

I was very new to react when I built this app. As you can see my code, I was pretty lost... I tried to refactor it once but decided to build it again from scratch later.

Since I know react better now, I should use routing and contextAPI. Also, I should plan better component architectures.
